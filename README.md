# Handwritten Digit Recognition  

This repository contains the code for a Handwritten Digit Recognition project. It uses a neural network to classify digits based on image input.  

## Project Overview  

The project is implemented with five main components:  
1. **Main.py**: Orchestrates the program flow.  
2. **RandInitialise.py**: Handles random initialization of weights.  
3. **Model.py**: Defines and trains the neural network model.  
4. **Prediction.py**: Generates predictions based on the trained model.  
5. **GUI.py**: Provides a user interface to interact with the model.  

## Dataset  

To use this project, you need to download the dataset for handwritten digit recognition.
